function E_SHD = getSpaceHeatingDemand(QsHL, Tout)
%getSpaceHeatingDemand> Calculate space heating demand in kW
%   The space heating demand is calculated in relation to outside
%   temperature and a building specific heating load.
%   Based on a linear regression model the mean daily heating power is
%   calculated. The space heating energy demand is determined by
%   multiplicating this power with 24h.
% Inputs:
%   QsHL - specific heat load of building in kW (double)
%   Tout - daily mean outside temperature in Â°C (double)
